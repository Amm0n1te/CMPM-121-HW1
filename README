DESCRIPTION
This scene is a rough sketch of a captain's cabin of a skyship.  I wasn't able to spend nearly as much time on this project as I would have liked, as I am taking an extremely difficult CSE class and I needed to work on my capstone 170 project.  I tried to target more wooden objects that look like they might have come from around the late 1800s or early 1900s.  The stove stands out a bit.  This scene was supposed to help depict a universe with ships and cities in the sky, great mechanical engines of magic, and elven kingdoms from faraway planets.  I wanted this to be the captain's cabin of a humble skyship called the Albatross, which is an old skyship upgraded countless times over the years. Obviously it's inspired by steampunk, but also of high fantasy and science fiction.  I wasn't able to find a free good model on the Unity Asset Store to act as a main character for this scene, so I just used a generic looking dummy.  I tried searching for pirates, sailors, officers, victorian era people, Renaissance era people, but I didn't find anything.
